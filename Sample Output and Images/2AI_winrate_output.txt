Sample run of two completely random AI players.

During each game iteration, the starting player is randomly chosen, for
fairness. Variables store player 1 and player 2 win counts. The command line
argument indicates the number of games to play. As expected, the base case of
two completely random AI players is a near perfect 50/50 split.

$ ./con4 10000

Player 1 win count: 4992

Player 2 win count: 5008
